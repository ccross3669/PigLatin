Assumptions

This program should work as desired with a few assumptions that were not explicitly detailed in the requirements documentation. 
I'll itemize the assumptions below. Some assumptions overlap one another. 
An example of this would be, one of the assumptions is that it is assumed that the user is using proper English and grammar. 
Another assumption states that there are no spaces between punctuation. 


1) The user is translating from English to Pig Latin. (This is stated in the requirements, but important to emphasize)
2) The user is using proper English grammar.
3) A "word" is defined by what is between a white space on a line of text.
4) The word must contain at least one vowel or it will not be translated.
5) The punctuation does not appear in the middle of the word.  i.e - I'm or check-in would not translate.
6) The input is user input and not from a file feed.
